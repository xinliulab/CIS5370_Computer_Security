# Project 3: Format String Exploit  

## **Overview**  
The goal of this project is to exploit a **format string vulnerability** on your machine. You will analyze the provided vulnerable code and implement an exploit to gain unintended control over the program.  

## **Task**  
1. Implement an **exploit** on your machine using the provided code.  
2. There are **two different exploit scripts** available in the repository. You may choose to implement **one** or **both**.  
3. You can perform the exploit on either a **32-bit** or **64-bit** system.  
4. You may work **individually** or **form a team** to complete this project.  

## **Submission**  
- As before, submit both your **code** and **report** in the `proj3` folder.  
- Your report should include:  
  - **Which exploit you implemented**  
  - **Which architecture (32-bit or 64-bit) you used**  
  - **Step-by-step explanation of how your exploit works**  
  - **Any issues encountered and how you resolved them**  

## **Good Luck & Have Fun! ðŸš€**
