lockdep: Tracking the acquisition order for every individual lock can incur significant overhead. A more efficient approach is to treat all locks initialized on the same line of code as the same lock, thereby greatly reducing the number of distinct locks. However, this optimization comes at the cost of detection precision. For example, in the classic dining philosophers problem, if all the forks (i.e., locks) are initialized on the same line, we lose the ability to distinguish the order in which they are acquired.
