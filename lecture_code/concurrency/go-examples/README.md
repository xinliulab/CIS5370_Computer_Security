**Golang Concurrency Case Study**:

Go provides a foundational mechanism for high I/O concurrency in data center applications, along with synchronization between goroutines. Conceptually, goroutines are equivalent to threads; however, their implementation is much more lightweight. Goâ€™s worker model enables both coroutine execution and I/O scheduling within a single thread.
