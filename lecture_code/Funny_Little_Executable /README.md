# Funny Little Executable (FLE)

FLE (Funny Little Executable) is a custom binary file format designed to support (static) linking and loading. We have developed a simple compiler, linker (leveraging `gcc/ld`), and loader for FLE. This format allows position-independent code with readable, writable, and executable memory mappings to be directly loaded and executed.
