**Symlink Game**:  
We can use symbolic links to create an *almost arbitrary* directory structure, including any graph-like structure (such as a state machine), and the operating system can still resolve it correctly.  
In this example, we simulated a maze from a MUD (Multi-User Dungeon) interactive gameâ€”you could even use this approach to implement a text-based Galgame.

You can use 

'''
pwd
'''

to check the operation history.
