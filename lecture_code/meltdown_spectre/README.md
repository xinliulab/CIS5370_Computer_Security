‚ùå Why can't we perform a real Meltdown attack anymore (on kernel addresses)?

After the Meltdown vulnerability was publicly disclosed in 2018, operating systems‚Äîespecially Linux‚Äîimplemented several mitigation strategies:

üîê KPTI (Kernel Page Table Isolation) was introduced:

In user mode, the kernel address space is no longer mapped into the page tables.

As a result, user programs cannot "see" any kernel memory addresses, not even during speculative execution.

Even if a user process tries to access a kernel address like 0xffff..., the CPU will immediately raise a page fault, and speculative execution will not be triggered on that memory access.
