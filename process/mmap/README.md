mmap: The Linux system uses anonymous mmap to allocate large contiguous memory regionsâ€”even at the moment the system call returns, the process may not have received any actual memory. Instead, allocation occurs only upon the first access when a page fault is triggered. AddressSanitizer utilizes mmap to allocate shadow memory, which we can observe using strace.
